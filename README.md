# OpenSearch Metadata-Hub

## Project mission
  The mission of the project is to setup the basic structure for the product and implement the core functionalities.
  These are:
  - run an OpenSearch node
  - run an OpenSearch-Dashboards container that connects to the OpenSearch node
  - automatically import data from a Metadata-Hub core into the OS node
  - provide a website with a search bar and elements to create more complex search queries (e.g. boxes to add extra filters to the search)
  - show statistics and graphs generated by the OpenSearch dashboard on the website that is intended for the user
  - wrap everything into docker containers and create a docker-compose file or bash script so users can start the whole system with one command

  Every customer has his own individual needs, especially when it comes to the statistics functionality. Thus, the whole product needs to be easily adaptable by the customer. We provide more of a template with some examples   of what could be done and how, than a production-ready product.
  Good documentation, not only on how to use the product but especially on what could be changed, how and where, is therefore mandatory!

## Start

Here, you can learn, how to start the OpenSearch-Metadata-Hub.

1) Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
2) Start "Docker Desktop" on your machine.
3) Go to [our repository](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2023ss02-open-search-meta-data-hub) and download the latest release of this project: ![image](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2023ss02-open-search-meta-data-hub/assets/105235679/1e809ffd-c11d-4c42-bd0f-a667ae1c3992)
4) Create a `.env`-file. It should contain key-value-pairs for `URL_CORE_1` and `PW_USER_CORE_1`, where you can store your credentials. Here is an example, how the contents should look like:
```
URL_CORE_1=https://metadahub.de/example
PW_USER_CORE_1=testpw
```
5) You should set the Linux setting `vm.max_map_count` to at least 262144. This is required by OpenSearch. You can read more about it in the [OpenSearch-Documenation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/#important-settings).
6) Navigate to the `src/`-folder and execute `docker compose up`. Alternatively, you can also execute `docker compose up -d` for detached mode.
7) Our website runs on port 8000, so you should be able to access it on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
8) Top stop all services, run `docker compose down` in `src/`.
9) You can use the `-v`-option in the last command to clear persistent data (e.g. to clear imported data). This action cannot be undone!

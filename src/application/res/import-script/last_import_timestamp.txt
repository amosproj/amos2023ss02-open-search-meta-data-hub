#
# The last_import_timestamp.txt file should store the timestamp value of the last import.
# This file serves as a persistent record that allows the import process to track the latest import and determine
# which data has been modified or added since then.
#
# In the update_last_import_timestamp method, the provided timestamp value is written
# to the last_import_timestamp.txt file.
# This ensures that the file always reflects the most recent import timestamp.
#
# The content of the last_import_timestamp.txt file should be a single line containing the timestamp value
# in a suitable format. For example, it could be a string representation of the timestamp in a standardized format
#  like ISO 8601 (e.g., "2023-06-08T15:30:00").
#
# When the import process is executed subsequently, it can read the value from the last_import_timestamp.txt file
# to determine the timestamp of the last import. This allows it to identify the data that has been modified or added
# since that timestamp and update the index accordingly.
#
# It's important to ensure proper error handling when reading from and writing to the last_import_timestamp.txt file
# to handle cases such as file not found, permission issues, or incorrect file format.
